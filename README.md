# plethorastoSys
Minecraft storage system using CC:Tweaked and plethora peripherals

not at all usable at the moment, if you must try then use 
wget to download the startup.lua file to a turtle has an ender modem on the right
and is connected to a bunch of chests through a wired modem and reboot
then download startup.lua to your neural interface with glasses, a clock, and an 
ender modem on the left and reboot

at the time of writing the neural interface part only shows the time
and the turtle accepts a few commands which are:
	dump: dumps the items in the turtle's invintory
	get <item>: retrieves a stack of the item for each of the turtle's slots
