# plethorastoSys
Minecraft storage system using CC:Tweaked and plethora peripherals

not at all usable at the moment, if you must try then use 
wget to download the startup.lua file to a turtle has an ender modem on the right
and is connected to a bunch of chests through a wired modem and reboot
then download startup.lua to your neural interface with glasses, a clock, and an 
ender modem on the left and reboot

at the time of writing the neural interface part only shows the time
and the turtle accepts a few commands which are:
	dump: dumps the items in the turtle's invintory
	get <item>: retrieves a stack of the item for each of the turtle's slots 
	
works in minecraft 1.12
do NOT put named items in the storage system, dont have any idea of how to deal with those
tools with damage values probably also break things
