all:
	make it not break with things that have a small stack sizes, 4 stacks of ender pearls is ok, but 64 pickaxes is not
	clean up code
	add comments
	rethink startup.lua/installer
	rethink file naming
	add appropriate errors
		can only have the one turtle on the network
		missing peripherals
	figure out why i lose my shell window on crash
	setup autocomplete with cc.choice

turtle:
	have table updates not recheck/rewrite the entire table
	add BIGdump? should probably dump turtle inventory on turtle_inventory event
	add defrag
	add get num empty slots
	might want to have a function to make the turtle suck and dump from an invintory in front of it or something
	add a boolean to the table slots slots: inLookup
	add a function in main that resends data whenever the storage is changed

networking:
	rethink what frequencies to use/how to store and get frequencies
	should i send nameLookup on storage update too?
		could send one message and check if second return exists

neural:
	gui will probably be split off at some point
	also want realtime
	waypoints would be really cool
	add player inventory/ender chest
	might setup a hotkey to use a kinetic module to stick a keyboard in my hand and click when i press it 
	make this searchable
	item drag and drop
	should make this scrollable, it would be cool to have inventory, enderchest, and a 3x3 crafting grid in the gui

	
crazy/interesting:
	could i place/destroy shulker boxes and use them for long term storage?
	might make seperate project for the gui
	make printout for item types stored, count would be cool too
	could change nameLookup to item types, have it store item name, damage, max stack size
