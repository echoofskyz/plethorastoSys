all:
	make it not break with things that have a small stack sizes, 4 stacks of ender pearls is ok, but 64 pickaxes is not
	clean up code
	rethink startup.lua/installer
	rethink file naming
	add appropriate errors
		can only have the one turtle on the network
		missing peripherals
	figure out why i lose my shell window on crash
	setup autocomplete with cc.choice

turtle:
	add BIGdump? should probably dump turtle inventory on turtle_inventory event
	add defrag
	add get num empty slots
	might want to have a function to make the turtle suck and dump from an invintory in front of it or something
	add a boolean to the table slots slots: inLookup
	add a function in main that resends data whenever the storage is changed

networking:
	rethink what frequencies to use/how to store and get frequencies
	
crazy/interesting:
	could i place/destroy shulker boxes and use them for long term storage?
	might make seperate project for the gui
	make printout for item types stored, count would be cool too
